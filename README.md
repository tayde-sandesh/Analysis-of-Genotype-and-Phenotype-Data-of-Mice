# Analysis-of-Genotype-and-Phenotype-Data-of-Mice
HACK-A-STAT Hackathon, NMIMS Mumbai


Analyzed a high‑dimensional mouse gene expression dataset (50 samples × 2,000 genes), showing that ordinary least squares is unsuitable due to severe overfitting and multicollinearity, and that screening via correlation to 200 genes followed by Ridge or Bayesian Ridge regression yields the most reliable phenotype predictions.
